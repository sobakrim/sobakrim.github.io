### Current Position
Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the BioSP Laboratory within INRAE, in France. My work focuses on developing advanced statistical methods to understand and predict environmental processes, contributing to the broader field of environmental statistics and climate science.

### Research Interests
My main research area encompasses statistics, space-time statistics, and machine learning, with a particular emphasis on applications in climate science. I am passionate about leveraging statistical models to better understand the complexities of climate variables and their impacts on natural and human systems. My work aims to provide insightful analyses that can inform policy and decision-making processes related to climate change and environmental management.
